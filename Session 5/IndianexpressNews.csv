"Friday, Dec 29, 2023",India sends request to Pak to extradite 26/11 mastermind Hafiz Saeed,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-sends-request-to-pakistan-to-extradite-26-11-mastermind-hafiz-saeed-9087652/,"India has sent an extradition request to the Pakistan government to hand over 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks mastermind Hafiz Saeed to face trial in the case, the Ministry of External Affairs said Friday.Addressing a press briefing, MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said Saeed is wanted in numerous cases in India and is also a UN-proscribed terrorist.“We have conveyed a request along with relevant supporting documents to the Government of Pakistan to extradite him to India to face trial in a particular case,” Bagchi said.Stating that the government has been flagging the issue of activities that Hafiz Saeed has been wanted for, the MEA official added that this was a recent request.Saeed, the founder of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), has been in jail in Pakistan since 2019 after being convicted for several years in multiple terror finance cases along with some other leaders of the banned Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD).The United States has placed a USD 10 million bounty on Saeed, a UN-designated terrorist. Saeed-led JuD is the front organisation for the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), which is responsible for carrying out the 2008 Mumbai attack that killed 166 people, including six Americans."
"Friday, Dec 29, 2023",Dhankhar refuses to appoint Raghav Chadha AAP's interim leader in Rajya Sabha — what the rules say,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/jagdeep-dhankhar-raghav-chadha-aap-interim-leader-rajya-sabha-rules-9087686/,"Rajya Sabha chairperson Jagdeep Dhankhar on Friday rejected the Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) request to appoint its MP Raghav Chadha as the interim leader of the party in the Upper House. The AAP wants Chadha to replace Sanjay Singh who is in judicial custody in the Delhi liquor scam case.On December 14, AAP national convener and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal wrote to Dhankhar proposing Chadha’s name for the party’s interim leader. “I would like to propose the name of Raghav Chadha as the interim party leader in the Rajya Sabha until further changes are deemed necessary. We request that this change be allowed as per the rules and procedures of the Rajya Sabha,” he wrote.But sources in the Rajya Sabha secretariat said the request was rejected as there was no provision for the appointment of an interim leader of a party under the Leaders and Chief Whips of Recognised Parties and Groups in Parliament (Facilities) Act, 1998.In his letter to Kejriwal, Dhankhar denied the request. “This aspect is subject to ‘The Leaders and Chief Whips of Recognised Parties and Groups in Parliament (Facilities) Act, 1998’, and the rules made thereunder. The request, not being in conformity to applicable legal regime, is not being acceded to,” wrote the Vice President.The Act deals with facilities to be provided to leaders and chief whips of recognised parties and groups in Parliament. It defines a “recognised group” as every party that has a strength of not less than 15 members and not more than 24 members in the Rajya Sabha, and a strength of not less than 30 members and not more than 54 members in the Lok Sabha.According to the Act, a “recognised party” must have a strength of not less than 25 members in Rajya Sabha and not less than 55 five members in Lok Sabha.As for facilities to the leaders and chief whips of recognised groups and parties, it says, “Each leader, deputy leader and each chief whip of a recognised group and a recognised party shall be entitled to telephone and secretarial facilities.”While sources in the AAP claimed that the Upper House secretariat had asked for some clarifications, to which it will respond, sources in the secretariat said it had sought no clarifications.AAP sources, however, maintain the request has not been denied but that “some corrections were sought, which will be addressed”. With Dhankhar turning down Kejriwal’s request citing rules, Sanjay Singh continues to remain the leader of the AAP in the Rajya Sabha.

"Friday, Dec 29, 2023","The Nitish way: Eye on bigger INDIA prize, takes first step, returns as party chief",https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/nitish-jdu-india-prize-party-chief-9087494/,"FOR JD(U) watchers, the coincidence is stark. Last time the party removed a sitting national president and Nitish Kumar took his place was April 2016, and the JD(U) leader’s star was on the rise as the man who had delivered Bihar to the UPA by a thumping majority. As talk that he was the alternative the Opposition needed against Narendra Modi was fanned by the win, Nitish got a reluctant Sharad Yadav to step down as party chief and replaced him – a clearing of way, of sorts.It is December 2023, and with months to go for the next general elections, the Opposition is even further away from an answer to Modi. As he drops hints, and waits, for the INDIA bloc to look his way, Nitish has gone in for a similar spring cleaning. On Friday, after fending off suggestions to this regard even a day earlier, Nitish returned as JD(U) national president, replacing a chastised Rajiv Ranjan Singh a.k.a Lalan Singh.However, that’s where the similarities end. In 2016, Nitish stood tall having led the Mahagathbandhan, also comprising the RJD and Congress, to 178 seats out of 243 in the Bihar Assembly polls of December 2015. The BJP, which had stunned Nitish an year earlier in the Modi-wave 2014 Lok Sabha polls by getting 31 seats, fell to 53 Assembly seats from 91 earlier.The victory was also sweeter for the fact that Nitish had broken away from the BJP to tie up with the Mahagathbandhan, in a literal rejection of Modi.Now, Nitish no longer enjoys that moral authority. If his anti-Modi credentials lie in tatters after he swapped sides to the BJP again in 2017 – as the UPA’s graph, and his ambitions, took a beating – the weight of numbers too is no longer on his side. In the last Assembly elections of Bihar, the JD(U) got nearly half the seats of both the BJP and RJD.That Nitish was able to effect a unanimous vote for him to return as JD(U) national president on Friday says more about the party, in which power has been getting concentrated in his hands – irrespective of who the national, or Delhi, face is.Lalan Singh does not even have the kind of national presence like Sharad Yadav had, who eventually did rebel – to little effect – making it even more easy for Nitish to have his way.Between Sharad Yadav and Lalan Singh, bureaucrat-politician R C P Singh served as JD(U) national president. But his tenure was short – December 2020 to July 2021 – with Singh choosing the BJP.JD(U) state president Umesh Kushwaha made no bones about the role the party fancies for Nitish. “The country is passing through a tough political phase. Nitish Kumar taking the party reins has become imperative now. We all wanted him to take full control of the party,” Kushwaha said.The move is also expected to quell simmering groupism within the party, with JD(U) leaders susceptible to both RJD and BJP pressures. Lalan himself was seen as having got unusually close to RJD chief Lalu Prasad and Bihar Deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav in recent days.However, given his precarious numbers, Nitish does not have as free a hand as before in deciding which way to turn. Many in the JD(U) are against any truck with the BJP again, and Nitish will have that in mind as the Mahagathbandhan could manage to continue without him with 114 seats in the House. Worse, any hints in this regard could cause the RJD to withdraw its generosity in letting Nitish continue as CM.Lalan Singh, who is unlikely to be touched by the RJD in a hurry, is expected to lie low and focus on retaining his Munger Lok Sabha seat. Seen to be part of the camp that is anti-BJP, he can now think of making a move only if Nitish dumps the RJD again.Lalan will also feel the isolation within the JD(U), with his resignation seen as partially a victory of senior party leaders Vijay Kumar Choudhary, Ashok Kumar Choudhary and Sanjay Kumar Jha.

"Friday, Dec 29, 2023","'Won't advise others what to do, but...': IUML drops another hint to ally Congress on Ram Temple invite",https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/iuml-drops-another-hint-to-ally-congress-on-ram-temple-invite-9087581/,"AFTER one of its leaders warned ally Congress against falling into “the BJP trap” over invitation to the Ram Temple consecration ceremony in Ayodhya, the IUML on Friday said that while it did not want to advise other parties on the issue, everyone should understand the BJP’s “agenda”.“The IUML gives extreme respect to the Hindu community’s faith and freedom of worship. But the BJP is converting the ceremony into inauguration of its campaign for the coming Lok Sabha elections. The BJP is using the event for political gains and everyone should understand it,” the IUML said, following a meeting of its political advisory committee in Kozhikode.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, Congress Parliamentary Party chairperson Sonia Gandhi and its Leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury have been invited by the temple trust for the ceremony. A close IUML affiliate had earlier questioned the fact that the Congress was non-committal on the issue.After the party meeting, IUML state president Sayyid Sadiq Ali Shihab Thangal said: “Every place of worship has its own significance and sacredness. In that respect, the IUML is with the faithful. But the party cannot agree with the BJP converting it into a political agenda.”The IUML was approaching the issue with “prudence”, Thangal said. “All secular parties should be able to stand united in politically handling the issue, upholding secular and constitutional values. The faithful should also recognise the BJP agenda, of making religious belief a cover for power. Political debates should hinge upon peoples’ issues such as hunger and unemployment,” he said.Senior legislator and party general secretary P K Kunhalikutty said the IUML would not comment on the stand to be adopted by other parties. “Regarding the Congress, they have the leadership to take a stand on the issue. We need not comment on it. They would have to analyse various issues at the national level. But, the use of this issue of worship for a political agenda… (this) should be (understood) by everyone. At this stage, we will not comment on the stand of other parties on this sensitive issue,’’ he said.Days back, the Samastha Kerala Jamiyyathul Ulama (SAMASTHA), seen as the backbone of the IUML, had attacked the Congress ambivalence over attending the ceremony. SAMASTHA mouthpiece Suprabhaatham, in its editorial, had stated: “The Congress stand that the party can attend the ceremony is only meant to prevent depletion of Hindu votes in North India. It is the soft Hindutva approach of the Congress that has taken the party, which ruled the country for 36 years, to the present situation.’’Several Congress leaders from Kerala have individually come out against the party attending the Ayodhya event, sensing the political fallout in the state. At a time when the IUML is being wooed by the CPI(M) too, SAMASTHA has appreciated the Left stand not to attend.Meanwhile, the BJP is relishing the predicament of the Congress, which cannot take a resolve such as the CPI(M) given its North India vote bank. On Friday, Kerala BJP president K Surendran said the Congress was “insulting” the majority Hindu community by not clarifying its stand on the Ram Temple invite.“Congress leaders in Kerala are threatening their party’s national leadership. Congress leaders M V Sudheeran and K Muraleedharan (who wanted the party to keep away from the event) should stop insulting the community,” Surendran said, adding that the same Congress which was “insulting Ram bhakts” had earlier held rallies in Kerala for “Hamas terrorists”.

"Friday, Dec 29, 2023",PM Modi to inaugurate Ayodhya airport tomorrow: Here's how it looks,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/pm-modi-ayodhya-airport-inauguration-9087629/,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi is slated to inaugurate the Shri Ram International Airport in Ayodhya on Saturday (December 30). This comes ahead of the grand ‘pran pratishtha’ (consecration ceremony) of the idol of Lord Ram in the under-construction Ram temple on January 22.Located 15 kms from the main Ayodhya city, the phase 1 of the airport has been developed at a cost of more than Rs 1,450 crore, according to a statement by the PMO.The Ayodhya airport will be named as ‘Maharishi Valmiki International Airport Ayodhya Dham’ and a notification in this regard is likely to be issued soon, an official was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.With a total area of 6,500 sqm, the airport’s terminal building is equipped to serve about 10 lakh passengers annually.The terminal building has been designed to depict “the architecture of the upcoming Shri Ram Mandir of Ayodhya,” the statement said. Even the main gateway has been built in a similar way, carrying a concrete core and cladding of sandstone, bearing stylised carvings.Uttar Pradesh| Preparations underway for the inauguration of the Ayodhya airportPrime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the Ayodhya Airport on December 30 pic.twitter.com/1wrwQdTmCH— ANI (@ANI) December 28, 2023Once inside, passengers can see the interiors decorated with local art, paintings and murals depicting the life of Lord Ram.As part of its modern infrastructure, the airport is equipped with various sustainability features like insulated roofing system, LED lighting, rainwater harvesting, landscaping with fountains, water treatment plant, sewage treatment plant, and solar power plant to meet GRIHA – 5 star ratings.The office of Union Civil Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia Thursday posted on X a video on the airport’s inauguration, and said: “This state-of-the-art airport, decorated with themes from the epic Ramayana, will take the development of pilgrimage and tourism in the entire region to new heights,” the post said.जिस प्रकार अयोध्या में राम मंदिर का निर्माण कार्य अपने शीर्ष पर है उसी प्रकार श्रद्धालुओं के स्वागत के लिए अयोध्या हवाईअड्डे का निर्माण भी अपने अंतिम चरण में है जिसका उद्घाटन 30 दिसंबर 2023 को प्रधानमंत्री श्री @narendramodi जी द्वारा संपन्न होगा। महाकाव्य रामायण के प्रसंगों से… pic.twitter.com/hajt7pdlUa— Office Of JM Scindia (@Officejmscindia) December 28, 2023The inaugural flight to land at the Ayodhya airport from Delhi is scheduled on Saturday.

"Friday, Dec 29, 2023","Sakshi Malik to quota Bill, welfare sops to MLAs, women can’t be ignored",https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/sakshi-malik-quota-bill-welfare-sops-mlas-women-9087424/,"The year started with Sakshi Malik and it is ending with Sakshi Malik. She became the face of the protesting wrestlers, including Olympic medallists, whose campaign compelled the government to suspend the newly-elected Wrestling Federation of India (WFI). The reason for the government’s action was the hold that BJP MP and ex-WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh continued to exercise over the body even after his exit, with serious allegations of sexual harassment of women wrestlers pending against him.Sakshi’s tearful visage, and her decision to hang up her boots despite an Olympic award winning career, was like another “Nirbhaya” moment. Many around the country identified with her—her anguish and frustration—and it agitated the already exercised Jat community. Despite weeks of sleeping on the pavements at Jantar Mantar earlier this year along with Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia (like Sakshi, they too returned their medals) and months of enquiry, it had seemed like going back to square one.But then came the unexpected turnaround: The Union Sports Ministry undid the new WFI team, putting the body under the Indian Olympic Association. Whatever be the factors which turned the key—international sports bodies, or more likely a political calculation that the cost would be greater than the benefit the controversial, albeit powerful, Brij Bhushan brought to the BJP — the ruling party was not willing to take the risk of facing the outrage of women four months ahead of the Lok Sabha elections.Brij Bhushan had his value, with his following amongst Rajputs in some parts of UP, and also as a factor to rein in Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in the state whenever required. But the government’s swift turnaround was an acknowledgement that women’s voice now counted more than ever before—and that they matter in the 2024 Big Battle.Looking back, the year 2023 belongs to the women of India.It was the gutsy wrestlers from Haryana—the land which has been known more for honour killings of women for marrying outside their castes—who protested publicly about an issue like sexual harassment, which often gets buried because it supposedly involves the “izzat” of the girl’s family. But rapid changes are sweeping parts of the country. Despite their concern about harassment of their daughters, the Jat farmers, as I found during my visit to the region, wanted their daughters to continue to train as sportspersons and excel and get global recognition—and they wanted action against the guilty.In the recent Assembly elections in five states, women overturned political outcomes which had been predicted. They are emerging as a powerful constituency—a group no party would like to ignore any more. It is now widely acknowledged that “Mama” Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s Ladli Behna Yojana raked in women votes which helped the BJP sweep Madhya Pradesh despite being in power for nearly 20 years – the scheme’s Rs 1,250 per month allowance was an empowering tool in the hands of a woman, money that was hers by right. So did the BJP’s proposed Mahtari Vandan scheme for women (to give them Rs 12,000 a year) make a difference in the Chhatisgarh polls.When women are allowed free travel in buses, it means freedom for many — to travel and visit places they were not able to see earlier. (A domestic help from West Bengal working in a South Delhi home had not seen India Gate despite having worked in the capital for ten years.) Like the rest of society, women’s aspirations are also rising. Mobile phones have helped them access not just the world of entertainment, an antidote to the drudgery in their lives, but opened a new window of opportunities for them.Ten-fifteen years ago, when I would ask young women in the rural areas what they aspired to become, their replies would mostly be a “teacher” or an “anganwadi worker”. Today eight out of ten women say they want to be “policewomen” — it connotes freedom and the right to wield power.The number of women elected to four out of five Assemblies has increased — in Chhattisgarh, from 14% to 21%; in MP, from 9% to 11.7%; in Telangana, from 5% to 8.4%; and in Mizoram their tally went up from zero to three MLAs. Only in Rajasthan, it came down marginally. However, the tickets given to women in these state polls amounted to only 10-15% of the total nominations. The representation of women inducted in the new ministries in these states is equally woeful.For all their growing awareness, and their emergence as a vote bank bolstered by welfare schemes, the parties are now vying to roll out, women’s equitable participation in the country’s politics, which is their due, still eludes them, as the process to ensure it remains painfully slow.While the government passed the women’s reservation Bill this year to give one-third representation to women in Parliament and state Assemblies, it is not likely to come into force before 2029 or 2034, with its implementation linked to the delimitation of constituencies slated to be undertaken in 2026. The parties could however still go ahead and give one-third of their tickets to women, not waiting for the Act to be operationalised. They can tap into the large pool of 15 lakh women who now have experience of thirty years of governing the country’s panchayats and municipal bodies (courtesy the 73rd and 74th Constitution Amendment Bills passed in 1992).The launch this week of a seminal biography on Vijay Lakshmi Pandit (by Manu Bhagvan, a professor of history in the US) is a walk down memory lane about the journey women in those early years covered. “Madame Pandit”, as she was popularly called, was India’s first woman cabinet minister and its ambassador to the United Nations. She was Jawaharlal Nehru’s sister — and a woman whom actor Marlon Brando “admired the most”. But the book is also a reminder about the galaxy of women who broke new grounds in India over the years.It was exactly a century ago — in 1924 — that a woman, Sarojini Naidu, became the president of the Congress party when it was spearheading the freedom movement. This was at a time when only one out of 100 women was literate.It was Aruna Asaf Ali who hoisted the national flag in Bombay (now Mumbai) on August 9, 1942, at August Kranti Maidan during the “Quit India” movement. It was Hansa Mehta who handed over the national flag to Rajendra Prasad in the Constituent Assembly in 1947 — and said, “It is in the fitness of things that the first flag flying over this august House should be a gift from the women of India.”Coming to the present, there are legions of Sakshi Maliks and Vinesh Phogats out there today waiting to demonstrate their talents. They just need the opportunity — and they need safe spaces. But we can be sure, the worm is now turning and can’t be ignored. And, 2023 has only underlined this message.(Neerja Chowdhury, Contributing Editor, The Indian Express, has covered the last 10 Lok Sabha elections. She is the author of ‘How Prime Ministers Decide’)

"Friday, Dec 29, 2023",‘We need to save our children’: Residents of Poonch village recall day security forces picked up civilians,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/jammu-and-kashmir-residents-topa-pir-security-forces-civilians-death-9087234/,"“Why did they punish them like this?”, “Who will return my son now”, “How can I trust the security forces anymore?”In Topa Pir, a hamlet of just 30 households located inside dense forests in Jammu, half an hour’s trek from the nearest road, there are more questions than answers. It is from here that nine men were picked up on December 22 in the aftermath of a terror attack that left four Army men dead. Three of those taken for questioning were allegedly tortured to death.“If they wanted to kill them, the Army should have just shot them,” said Nazir Hussain (60), the father of Mohd Showkat (26). “Itna saza deke kyun maara? (Why kill them after so much punishment?).” Showkat’s wife, Kausar Bi, said his body had turned “siyaah” (black) with bruises.From Buffliaz, in Poonch, a 10 kilometre drive on an under-construction road leads to an unmarked point in the forest where only locals know that the climb to Topa Pir begins. After about 25 minutes of trekking along the edge of the mountain, the first mud houses – surrounding a shrine on top of a steep mountain – start coming into view.The houses, mostly mud and some with cement plaster, are not more than a floor each. On Thursday, scores of policemen held guard as relatives poured in from neighbouring villages to meet the families and offer condolences as access to the village was permitted for the first time since December 22. Anyone with a smartphone in the village has a picture of the three men, and any child can point you to their homes.On Tuesday, senior Army officers had paid the homes a visit to assure action in the case, and a day later, the families were taken to meet Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, who promised them justice.The families recall that on December 22, “about 12 Army men, some in plain clothes, some in uniform” asked Safeer Ahmad and Mohd Showkat to step out of their homes and had the men follow them to the nearby post. Shabir Ahmad and Riyaz were fetching water at a canal away from the village, but as per the family, “they were taken from there itself,” said Shabir’s father Wali Mohammad.While Safeer, Shabir and Showkat died in custody, Riyaz is currently hospitalised in another part of the district.A total of nine men were picked up that morning. The oldest, Lal Hussain, is believed to be 85 years old and the youngest 15. The families had anticipated that the men would return in a few hours after routine questioning. “The first person to return that day was Lal Hussain, around 3.30 pm. He said we need to go to the camp and save our children,” said Wali Mohammad (60), Shabir’s father. “The women – his wife and mother and others from families whose men were taken – ran to the nearest Army post. Lal Hussain had narrated to the villagers the scenes of torture he witnessed.”On Thursday, Safeer Ahmed’s wife Zarina and five-year-old daughter Kubra quietly watched the commotion in their house. His mother, Zeenat Bi (76), said, “I was standing next to him when the man in plainclothes asked for his phone and told Safeer to accompany him. He had just got water for the house and we had tea together that morning. Who will return my son now?” Of her four sons and daughters, Safeer was the only one who stayed at Topa Pir, taking care of his ageing parents, wife and four kids, the youngest of whom is two years old.His brother Noor Ahmed broke down recounting the state in which they received the bodies the next day. “Safeer had cuts on his head, burn marks along his arms and his whole back and had turned black from bruises. Even his eyes were swollen,” he said, adding that he did not let Safeer’s children see their father’s body. “I only let them see his face and we buried him on the patch of land behind the house.”From the top of Shabir’s house, Mohammad Wali, the caretaker of the Topa Pir ziarat, pointed to the jungle in front of the house where gunshots from the militant attack rang out on December 21. “The quiet of this place is rarely broken and we noticed the gunshots. An attack here is unheard of since this is a very remote place,” he said.The J&K administration has announced a compensation of Rs 20 lakh for each of the families, a plot of land and a government job for the next of kin of the deceased. The Army, sources said, will provide a compensation of Rs 10 lakh.Safeer’s mother, however, asked: “Bacche ki keemat koi de sakte hai? (Can anyone decide the cost of my child’s life?)” She said that his body came wrapped up in a blanket, and his clothes have not yet been returned to the family.The cold comfort, families said, is that they were able to bury the bodies – “in whatever state”. They said that as they were looking for them at the three different Army posts within 12 kilometres of their village, they were apprehensive the men would be “labelled militants and never be seen again”.The community, largely resigned to the highest and toughest regions of Jammu and Kashmir, has held a relationship of trust with the Army. Which is why, on December 22, no one in Topa Pir initially suspected that the men would not return home. “I am afraid for myself and my other son as well now. How will I trust them anymore?” asked Nazir Hussain.Shabir’s father said his son worked as a labourer in Saudi Arabia for five years before coming home. “He was diabetic; he said mujhse ab mazdoori nahin hoti (I can’t do hard labour anymore).” Eyes filled with tears, he added, “He returned to a place where no one returns, only to die such a brutal death.”

With his boy-next-door looks, chivalry and his swoon-worthy romantic actions, he robbed the audience of critical thinking and charmed them, especially women, with his roles of a lover. He came at a time when the audience was done revering middle-aged heroes (Rajendra Kumar, Dilip Kumar) and wanted a new generation actor to express their dreams and desires onscreen. Not just youngsters, but even the older generation lapped up this storehouse of talent.“In all my films, people identified strongly with my character. Every college girl wanted a boyfriend like me, every mother wanted her son to be like me, and every sister wanted her brother to be like me. All the married women dreamt of a husband like me. Together, they made Rajesh Khanna the screen idol that he was,” the actor had said in a 1989 interview.Also read | Mohammed Rafi: The ‘Man of God’ who made a star out of Shammi Kapoor; promised Rajiv Gandhi free shows to help Kishore KumarRajesh Khanna was unlike today’s stars. He didn’t have a well-built physique or looks that would stop people in their tracks, yet he managed to turn heads as he brought a stamp of class and sensitivity to his characters. Moviegoers connected with him as he conveyed their emotional vulnerabilities on screen with the utmost sincerity and passion. Hrishikesh Mukherjee, as actor Rakhee told Etimes, believed, “Nobody can compete with Rajesh Khanna. It is impossible. He wasn’t there for his body and height but just for his face, smile and eyes.”While he did impress with his initial films like Aakhri Khat (1966), Raaz (1967) and Baharon Ke Sapne (1967), Khanna came to his own and became invincible with Aradhana (1969), Do Raaste (1969), Ittefaq (1969), Safar (1970), Kati Patang (1971), Khamoshi (1969), and several others. Actor Deepti Naval, who watched Khanna’s Aradhana thirteen times with her sister, told Scroll, “He was the dream man of every girl. I felt no other actor could have done ‘Roop tera mastana’ like Rajesh Khanna, treading a fine line between forbidden love and desire…” Naval and her sister even wore a Guru kurta to watch his film Safar. “We were that crazy about Rajesh Khanna.” Not just the actor and her sister, millions of girls were in love with the ‘superstar’. He used to receive fan mail in abundance, some of which were supposedly written in blood. His car would be covered in lipstick marks wherever it was parked.Also read | Revisiting Bawarchi and Rajesh Khanna’s uncomplicated simplicitySharmila Tagore said in an interview with The Indian Express, “Women came out in droves to see Kaka (Khanna). They would stand in queues outside the studios to catch a glimpse. They would marry his photographs, and they would pull at his clothes. Delhi girls were crazier for him than Mumbai girls. He needed police protection when he was in public. I have never seen anything like this before and since.”Born Jatin Khanna, on December 29, 1942, in Amritsar, Punjab, the actor was brought up by foster parents, Chunnilal and Leelawati Khanna, and he never spoke of his biological parents. He was a much-pampered kid who attended Mumbai’s St Sebastian Goan High School, where he became friends with Ravi Kapoor, who later gained popularity as Jeetendra. After completing his studies at Kishinchand Chelleram College, Khanna, who was already doing theatre, decided to pursue acting. He approached several filmmakers with his pictures but got no response from them. But Khanna’s struggle story was a little different from others as he came from a well-to-do family that was willing to support him financially. Gautam Chintamani’s biography on the actor mentioned that he “drove to auditions in a car and had a monthly allowance of Rs 10,000.”In 1965, he was presented with a unique opportunity as some of the famous producers and directors from the Hindi film industry, including BR Chopra, Guru Dutt, and Bimal Roy, organised a talent contest along with Filmfare to find a new face for the film industry.Also read | Dimple Kapadia: A versatile performer who has redefined portrayal of older womenRajesh Khanna beat 10,000 contestants and won the 1965 All India Talent Contest organised by United Producers and Filmfare. The talent hunt contract specified that 12 different producers would sign the winner for 12 films. Hence, a golden chance to rise to stardom. The first film he signed was GP Sippy’s Raaz and subsequently, Chetan Anand approached him for Aakhri Khat. Though he was happy to have gotten two films early in his career, what bothered him was the call time for Raaz, which was 9 am. He told Bhawana Somaya for ‘Echoes of an Era’, “Now, waking up early is just not my style. I am not an early bird. From childhood, I have always risen late. My mother wouldn’t allow anyone to enter my room and disturb me. So when the director told me about attending shooting early in the morning, my heart sank.”On the day of the shoot, Khanna arrived at 11 am and instead of being apologetic, he hit back at a senior team member who questioned his behaviour despite being a newcomer, “To hell with the career and to hell with this film. My lifestyle cannot change for my career.” This remained the actor’s attitude throughout his career, as confirmed by Prem Chopra in one of his interviews. “Rajesh Khanna was a great actor, but he had this habit of reaching late all the time. Not everyone would take it when he landed late on sets. Hours after everyone reached and got ready, he would reach the sets.” Even in her latest appearance on Koffee With Karan, when Sharmila Tagore was asked to describe Khanna in two words, she replied, “Perpetually late.”However, filmmakers grew habitual of Khanna’s habit of always turning up late and continued to cast him for his impeccable screen presence. The actor holds the record of delivering 17 consecutive super-hits in three years from 1969-71, which included 15 successive solo super-hit films, starting with Ittefaq (1969) and Aradhana (1969). Ramesh Deo, who played Dr Prakash in Anand, recalled that Khanna was perpetually late on the sets of Anand, and this would infuriate Hrishikesh Mukherjee. But as soon as he saw what the actor did in front of the camera, his anger would melt away. In a 2012 conversation with DNA, Deo said, “Rajesh used to enact the scene so well, that after the scene, Hrishi-da used to say, ‘Tumne itna aacha kam kiya hai, tumhare sau gunah maaf (You have done such good work that all your sins are forgiven).’”By the time Anand released in 1971, Khanna had reached the pinnacle of success and had become a ‘phenomenon’. The mass hysteria around him remains unbeatable to this day. In fact, at one point, he himself felt, “next to God”.“He was the biggest star ever. From 1969 to 1975, the high that he touched became a benchmark that nobody could breach. You could identify with him. He had a very charming smile. He had a good voice and he also got really good music. When a person’s stars start working in his favour, then he gets support from every sphere,” screenwriter Salim Khan once said about Khanna to BBC.Also read | Rajesh Khanna’s obsession with death and his songs that celebrated mystery of lifeHowever, by the mid-seventies, Rajesh Khanna’s hold over the box office had begun to slip, increasing his insecurities. He only wished to be surrounded by people who praised him, and those who spoke anything which was not favourable to him became his enemy. His starry tantrums were no longer taken by filmmakers and he was once reportedly slapped by Mehmood when he was directing him in Janta Hawaldar. Yash Chopra also couldn’t handle his “superstar tantrums on a regular basis”. In 1973, when Khanna worked with the emerging star Amitabh Bachchan, he believed nobody could replace him. Actor Asrani recalled in a 2018 interview with Filmfare, “There was a basic courtesy between the two but Rajesh suffered from a superiority complex. He believed ‘no one can shake me. I am too powerful.’ Throughout the film, there was palpable tension between the two.”The dried-up offers were also a result of Khanna’s unwillingness to reinvent himself. “He continued the same style and those films did not work either. That is why he had to (suffer a downfall). He could not face that thing – where I was and where I am now,” Prem Chopra had said while explaining the superstar’s downfall from the numer-uno position.The failure led him to alcoholism and one night after drinking, he started yelling from the terrace of his Mumbai bungalow, Ashirvaad. This was the phase of Khanna’s career when he had seven consecutive flops. “One after another, seven films had just flopped in a row. It was raining, pitch-dark and up there alone on my terrace, I lost control. I yelled out. ‘Parvardigar, hum garibon ka itna sakt imtihan na le ki hum tere vajood ko inkar kar de (God, don’t test my patience to such an extent that I question your very existence).’ Of course, Dimple (Kapadia, his wife) and my staff came running, thinking that I had gone insane. It was because success hit me so much that I couldn’t take the failure,” he shared with Movie Magazine in 1990.One of the actor’s dialogues from Daag (1973) sums up the ups and downs of his life, which he later recreated on the stage at an event with much of the film industry in attendance, “Izzatein, shohratein, ulfatein, chahatein, sab kuch iss duniya mein rehta nahin/ Aaj main hun jahan kal koi aur tha/ Ye bhi ek daur hai woh bhi ek daur tha. (Nothing is permanent in life. somebody else was here where I am today).” A day came in Khanna’s life when he, who once felt “next to God”, thought of himself to be a ‘dog’.Also read | Rajesh Khanna’s best friend remembers actor’s last day: ‘Akshay Kumar and I were by his feet, Dimple Kapadia was near his daughters’He told Filmfare, “I used to ask my man Prashant to tell the caller that Kaka is having a bath and call up again just to feign importance and attend to the call only when the caller called up four times. God punished me and a time came when I used to stand next to the phone hoping that I would get a call. And when one day a call came, I picked the receiver and said,’ Kaka here,’ and then came the reply, ‘Kaun Kaka? Wrong Number.’ That was when I realized that I was not GOD but DOG.”Rajesh Khanna continued to work in the 80s, but unlike the early 1970s, he failed to pull people to cinema halls. One of the last notable roles that he did was in Rishi Kapoor’s Aa Ab Laut Chelein in 1999.At the peak of his career, Khanna married 16-year-old Dimple Kapadia, whom he met on a flight to Ahmedabad. The two got married six months before Kapadia’s Bobby released. But Kapadia knew her marriage with the superstar wouldn’t last long from the moment she stepped into his house. On The Pritish Nandy Show, the actor said she could not understand the superstar. Revisiting the pre-separation phase of her life, Kapadia said, “I think we were two very different kinds of people. I was probably very young to understand what was happening to this man, who was a superstar. I have never been able to understand stars and their behaviour pattern at all because I am not one myself. I just couldn’t understand.”The duo separated in 1982 and have two daughters – Twinkle Khanna, who was born in 1974, and Rinkie Khanna, born in 1977.Before marrying Dimple, Rajesh Khanna was in a seven-year-long relationship with Anju Mahendru. When he married Kapadia, he deliberately made his baraat parade before Anju’s house. After separating from Kapadia, he also got involved with Tina Munim, who allegedly left him because he didn’t divorce Kapadia.Journalist Bhawana Somaaya summarised Khanna’s life in a Screen article which was published in 1987: “Rajesh Khanna became more rigid and withdrew into his shell. If Anju couldn’t cope with his success, Dimple couldn’t cope with his failure.”But, all the people he was close to returned to him during his last days, including Dimple Kapadia and her daughter, and Anju Mahendru. He was admitted to Mumbai’s Lilavati Hospital due to prolonged illness, but he insisted on dying in his bedroom. The family brought him back to Aashirvaad and tried to lift his spirit by saying that he will be well soon. But Khanna knew it was time on July 18, 2012. Yasser Usman revealed the actor’s last word in his biography, “Time up ho gaya [My time is up] . . . Pack up!”Click for more updates and latest Bollywood news along with Entertainment updates.

"Friday, Dec 29, 2023",3 'forgotten' foods you must include in your winter diet,https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/food-wine/winter-supefoods-healthy-diet-rujuta-diwekar-9087625/,"As the winter chill sets in, it is also time to modify your diet to suit the season’s unique needs. While staples like soups and stews take center stage, there are some forgotten winter superfoods that deserve a spot on our plates. These nutritional powerhouses not only add variety to our meals but also offer a range of health benefits.Celebrity nutritionist Rujuta Diwekar recently took to Instagram to share often-overlooked winter foods that can contribute to our well-being during the colder months.Edible gum, known as Goond in Hindi, is a popular and healthy winter food in North India. Derived from the white or brown crystals of the Acacia plant, it is a key ingredient in winter sweets like ladoos, panjiri, and halwa.Although it is primarily used as a binding and thickening agent in foods and beverages, Deepti Khatuja, chief clinical nutritionist, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurgaon, explains that Goond is celebrated for its warming properties during colder months, helping maintain body temperature and alleviating cold-related symptoms.It is also a rich source of fibre, which helps in digestion. “Goond prevents constipation and other digestive issues that occur during winter season due to reduced physical activity,” Khatuja shared.Goond is also praised for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which protects against oxidative stress, strengths the immune system, and promotes joint health. Apart from this, it is high in carbohydrates, calcium and magnesium, thereby boosting energy levels and ensuring nutrition for pregnant women.Also known as spring garlic, Hari Lassan boasts a high concentration of antioxidants called Allicin. “This compound aids in reducing cholesterol, combating inflammation, and preventing common winter ailments like coughs, colds, and flu,” said Khatuja.The green garlic’s immune-boosting properties and ability to reduce oxidative stress make it a valuable addition to winter diets. While some research suggests anti-cancer properties, Khatuja noted that more evidence is needed to substantiate this claim.Hari Lassan can be used to add flavour to soups, stews, curries and stir-fries. You can also enjoy it chopped in salads or dips for a burst of freshness.Turnips are root vegetables belonging to the Brassicaceae family. Low in calories, these veggies are loaded with essential nutrients, antioxidants and dietary fibre, these veggies provide a host of benefits.“Rich in antioxidants like vitamin C, E, beta-carotene, and manganese, turnips combat the harmful effects of free radicals. The sulforaphane compound in turnips exhibits anti-cancer properties, while their fibre content aids digestion and prevents constipation. Turnips also contribute to heart health, bone health, and possess anti-inflammatory properties due to the presence of omega-3 fatty acids, Vitamin K, and Vitamin B complex,” Khatuja said.Including turnips in your winter meals also ensures added taste. “Roast it for a satisfying side dish, stir-fry it for a light and flavourful meal, or blend it into soups and stews for a warm and comforting experience,” Khatuja noted.Check out the post below:   A post shared by Rujuta Diwekar (@rujuta.diwekar) "
"Friday, Dec 29, 2023",Discover Less Explored Travel Destinations This New Year,https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/sponsored-lifestyle/discover-less-explored-travel-destinations-this-new-year-9083455/,"Embark on a journey of a lifetime with friends and family to wrap up 2023, celebrating life amid stunning destinations. Whether you’re drawn to festive fiestas, leisurely strolls, sunset reflections, or cultural immersions, shape a personalized adventure that resonates with you.In this article, we will share the list of less explored international destinations and talk about how following some simple dos and don’ts can make your trip more enjoyable and memorable. While exploring these picture-perfect Instagram-worthy spots, it is essential to stay connected throughout your journey. This ‘Must-Do’ goes beyond strengthening your social media presence; it is also about alleviating the discomfort of unfamiliarity, enabling you to fully enjoy and relish your trip with an International Roaming pack on your existing number.The lesser known destinations that should be on your radar to conclude your 2023:Cinque Terre, Italy: With vibrant coastal villages, scenic trails, and delectable cuisine, Cinque Terre, Italy, is located in Liguria and is easily accessible from Genoa and Pisa.Luang Prabang, Laos: Luang Prabang, Laos, unveils a gem of natural beauty and culture with its UNESCO-listed old town, Kuang Si Falls, and the Royal Palace Museum.Tbilisi, Georgia: A city with the charm of the Old Town and sights such as Narikala Fortress and the Georgian National Museum, Tbilisi seamlessly blends history, culture, and delectable cuisine.Ronda, Spain: Reveal Ronda, Spain, is renowned for the dramatic El Tajo gorge, Puente Nuevo bridge, and Plaza de Toros bullring.Hoi An, Vietnam: Discover the charm of Hoi An, Vietnam, as you stroll through the lantern-lit Ancient Town, visit the Japanese Covered Bridge, and explore the Quan Cong Temple.Queenstown, New Zealand: Queenstown, New Zealand, invites you to indulge in outdoor adventures like skiing, hiking, bungee jumping, and scenic cruises on Lake Wakatipu.Oaxaca, Mexico: Oaxaca, Mexico, offers diverse experiences, from colonial architecture, the Monte Albán ruins, and the Zócalo to the festivities of the Day of the Dead and Guelaguetza.Kotor, Montenegro: Kotor, Montenegro, offers a medieval Old Town vibe with the St. Tryphon Cathedral, the Kotor Carnival, Mediterranean-inspired seafood, black risotto, and grilled fish.How to Make Your Journey Safe and ComfortableResearch and Plan Ahead:Before your trip, thoroughly research the destination. Understand the local customs, culture, laws, and any safety concerns. Plan your itinerary, but also leave room for flexibility. There are many great apps and websites that can help you in your planning such as skyscanner, Rome2Rio, Citymapper and many more. Stay Connected:Traveling often involves the hassle of changing networks, swapping SIM cards, navigating online payments, and dealing with specific apps in areas with poor network connectivity. Relying solely on Wi-Fi is not a dependable option since it’s not available everywhere. Additionally, using public Wi-Fi can be risky due to potential safety concerns or unreliable signals. However, a convenient solution is to activate international roaming on your existing Airtel number. Airtel offers international roaming packs starting at just 133/day, which is quite reasonable.Learn Basic Local Phrases:While English is widely spoken in many places, learning a few basic phrases in the local language shows respect and can be incredibly helpful, especially in more remote areas. Duolingo and Google translate can be your great travel companions to help you overcome language barriers.Valuables and Security: As you meet your fellow adventurers along the way, ensure that, as you share the experience, you do not divulge personal information or passwords. Also, be careful when using public wi-fi, ATMs, or any online payment modes, as they may be unsafe or unsecure. Instead, consider activating international roaming on your existing mobile number to ensure a secure browsing experience.Know Emergency Contact Information:Familiarize yourself with local emergency contact numbers and the location of the nearest embassy or consulate. Save important documents and numbers in your phone and have a physical copy as well. TripIt is a travel organizer app that can store important documents and itineraries.All in all, with a few precautions, you can have a trip worth remembering and celebrating with friends and family. And with seamless connectivity, you can stay linked with the rest of the world, share experiences in real-time, and navigate through unfamiliar landscapes hassle-free.So, this New Year’s, the world is your oyster! Disclaimer: This content is sponsored and does not reflect the views or opinions of IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd.

"Friday, Dec 29, 2023",Why Choose Tata AIG Comprehensive Car Insurance For Your Vehicle?,https://indianexpress.com/article/auto-travel/sponsored-auto-travel/why-choose-tata-aig-comprehensive-car-insurance-for-your-vehicle-9084422/,"Comprehensive car insurance policies cover damages and losses caused to both parties during an accident, i.e., you and the third party individual. However, when choosing a comprehensive plan, it is vital to assess the insurer just as thoroughly as the insurance policy. After all, your four-wheeler insurance is only as good as the insurer offering it.With reputed insurers like Tata AIG, you get to buy your policy from the comfort of your home. As insurers, they also offer a slew of other value-added services to help bolster their car insurance policies. Read on to find out why you should choose Tata AIG’s comprehensive car insurance plans!  Here is a more in-depth explanation of the points stated above and how Tata AIG car insurance benefits apply:Tata AIG’s new car insurance policy will offer you third-party and own damage coverage. This means both you and the third party will be compensated for any vehicular losses during an accident, regardless of who was at fault.  Moreover, in the event of a total loss – due to theft or major car accidents, you will be reimbursed your car’s total IDV value. If you opt for AIG’s Return to Invoice add-on cover, you will be reimbursed the total invoice amount of your car.You would think that premiums would be sky-high for a policy with such extensive coverage, but that is not the case with Tata AIG car insurance. This is because online policies do not require the presence of any middlemen or intermediary parties like brokers or agents.This allows them to cut down on these additional costs, allowing them to offer more affordable premiums and discounts for customers who buy car insurance online.Nearly all your insurance processes can be initiated and resolved on Tata AIG’s website. This means quick and streamlined buying, renewal and claims processes with minimal paperwork. You can also claim cashless services at one of their 7500+ network garages, where Tata AIG will directly settle the bill once repairs are done. This means no last-minute gathering of funds on your part and a stress-free claims process.Renewals can be done within a matter of minutes on Tata AIG’s website. All you need to do is enter your car registration number and click Renew! Moreover, if you have a claim-free year, you are offered a No Claim Bonus (NCB) discount on your premiums during Tata AIG car insurance renewals. This can be accrued up to 50% for 5 consecutive claim-free years with Tata AIG.  You can further protect this discount by adding a No Claim Bonus Protection add-on to your policy. You get access to 17 add-on covers under a Tata AIG car insurance policy. This will allow you to further expand and customise the coverage your plan offers. These do require an additional premium payment. However, they are worth the expense if you consider their benefits:For example, Zero Depreciation can help mitigate out-of-pocket expenses during repairs.  You should note that add-ons are only offered for Tata AIG’s comprehensive car insurance policy. You cannot buy them if you have third party car insurance. Hence, we recommend upgrading your policy to a comprehensive plan to gain access to them.  Tata AIG’s comprehensive car insurance plan is recommended for new and luxury car owners, road trippers, residents of high-risk areas and metropolitan areas and new drivers. It offers all-around coverage and ensures that your most prized possession stays protected when on the road.  Disclaimer: This content is sponsored and does not reflect the views or opinions of IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd.

"Friday, Dec 29, 2023","Technology, I’m in favour of it… but it’s bringing curse into the game: Mohammad Hafeez reacts to Mohammad Rizwan’s controversial dismissal",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/technology-im-in-favour-of-it-but-its-bringing-curse-into-the-game-mohammad-hafeez-reacts-to-mohammad-rizwans-controversial-dismissal-9087733/,"Mohammad Rizwan’s dismissal during the fourth day of the Australia vs Pakistan Test has sparked a controversy. The wicket has tilted the game’s balance significantly and helped Australia win and seal the series. Pakistan coach Mohammad Hafeez, reacting to the decision after the game, would say technology is putting a “curse” on the game. “Technology, I’m in favour of it if it’s giving you the benefit, but if it’s bringing some doubt and some curse into the game, it should not be acceptable by anyone,” Hafeez told the reporters. “I think there are a lot of areas that need to be addressed for the betterment of cricket in general where technology is taking away from the instinct of the game,” Hafeez added.Wicket 250 for Pat Cummins! 🎉The third umpire decided the ball flicked Mohammad Rizwan's sweatband on the way through. #MilestoneMoment | @nrmainsurance | #AUSvPAK pic.twitter.com/vTuDL5DmNB— cricket.com.au (@cricketcomau) December 29, 2023Chasing 318 runs, Pakistan were well in the game at 219-5 when Rizwan, batting on 35, tried to leave a short ball. The ball hit him on the lower right arm and carried to wicket-keeper Alex Carey, and the Australians appealed. Michael Gough’s on-field umpire did not give it out, and Cummins challenged the decision and sent it upstairs. Third umpire Richard Illingworth referred to the spike on ultra edge as the ball passed Rizwan’s wristband, and Illingworth asked Gough to overturn his original decision of not out. Noticeably, there was no mark on the hotspot as the ball passed Rizwan.The Pakistan keeper-batter was unhappy with the decision and suggested that the ball had brushed his forearm instead of the wristband. “I spoke to him (Rizwan), and he’s sincere. What he said to me was he did not even feel that it touched anywhere near the gloves,” Hafeez said. “And we know there should be conclusive evidence for the third umpire to reverse the decision.”“The umpire gave it not out, and there was no clear, conclusive evidence that the decision has to be turned over,” he added."
"Friday, Dec 29, 2023",Decode Politics: Why inauguration of 1st temple in Abu Dhabi significant for PM Modi?,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/abu-dhabi-temple-baps-narendra-modi-9087742/,"Weeks after the Ayodhya temple consecration ceremony, another temple inauguration is on the table for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He will head to Abu Dhabi for the inauguration ceremony of the BAPS Hindu Mandir on February 14.This move has already prompted criticism from the Opposition.Thiruvananthapuram MP and senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said on X that he “expects elections to be called soon after” the BAPS event.So Prime Minister @NarendraModi will inaugurate the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya on January 22nd and the BAPS Hindu Temple in Abu Dhabi on February 14th. I expect elections to be called very soon thereafter.The message is clear. In 2009, Mr Modi was sold to the Indian electorate as…— Shashi Tharoor (@ShashiTharoor) December 29, 2023“The message is clear…In 2019, with that narrative collapsing in the wake of the disastrous demonetisation, the Pulwama terrorist attack gave Mr Modi the opportunity to convert the general election into a national security election. In 2024, it is clear the BJP will now revert to its core message and offer Narendra Modi to the nation as a Hindu Hriday Samrat.”BAPS stands for the Bochasanwasi Shri Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS).It “is a socio-spiritual Hindu faith with its roots in the vedas” and was pioneered by Bhagwan Swaminarayan (1781-1830) in the late 18th century and established in 1907 by Shastriji Maharaj (1865-1951), the organisation’s website says.The BAPS claims to run over 3,850 centres across the world, including in places such as New Jersey and Los Angeles, and 1,100 mandirs or temples, its website notes. The Akshardham temples in Delhi and Gujarat are also run by BAPS.Among the practices followed by members of this tradition is beginning “the day with puja and meditation”. Among its five lifetime vows are “no alcohol, no addictions, no adultery, no meat, no impurity of body and mind”.As per a press note on the BAPS website, Swami Ishwarcharandas and Swami Brahmaviharidas invited the PM on behalf of the BAPS Hindu Mandir in Abu Dhabi for the inauguration ceremony.“Discussions revolved around Abu Dhabi temple’s significance for global harmony and Modi’s vision for India’s spiritual leadership on the global stage,” the press release notes.During this conversation, the PM is said to have recalled “his personal and immortal memories of Pramukh Swami Maharaj” who was a former head of the tradition. He died in 2017.The BAPS temple is the first temple in the Emirati capital and it follows the PM’s push for the same.In fact, as part of his two-day visit to the Gulf nation in 2015, just one year into his tenure as PM for the first time, the UAE decided to allot land for building a temple in Abu Dhabi. This visit was crucial diplomatically as Modi became the first Indian Prime Minister after Indira Gandhi to visit this strategic Gulf nation in 34 years.Modi had thanked the UAE leadership for this “landmark” decision. He had also visited the historic Sheikh Zayed grand mosque, the world’s third largest, as part of this visit.And in February 2018, the PM inaugurated the project for the temple. The UAE also has the highes Indian diaspora population (3.5 million), followed by ), the United States of America (2.7 million) and Saudi Arabia (2.5 million), as per the International Migration 2020 report by the UN.The BAPS press release on the invitation to Modi also notes that their discussions with him included “strengthening relationships with the UAE and other Middle Eastern countries”.PM Modi is said to have spoken about the “ideal of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam – an ideal spiritual space, not merely rooted in beliefs and traditions, but a confluence of diverse cultures and civilizations”. This is a point the PM has been reiterating as part of his diplomatic endeavours.In September 2019, Modi inaugurated the Shri Siddhivinayak temple and a centre in Houston, Texas.And in June 2020, he launched a $ 4.2 million redevelopment project of a 200-year-old Lord Sri Krishna temple in Manama, the capital of Bahrain.

It covers essential topics of static and dynamic parts of the UPSC Civil Services syllabus covered under various GS papers. This answer-writing practice is designed to help you as a value addition to your UPSC CSE Mains. Attempt today’s answer writing on questions related to topics of GS-1 to check your progress.Discuss how the concept of Indian Union Territories was developed and implemented.Why does it rain in southern India in December?Introduction— The introduction of the answer is essential and should be restricted to 3-5 lines. Remember, a one-liner is not a standard introduction.— It may consist of basic information by giving some definitions from the trusted source and authentic facts.Body— It is the central part of the answer and one should understand the demand of the question to provide rich content.— The answer must be preferably written as a mix of points and short paragraphs rather than using long paragraphs or just points.— Using facts from authentic government sources makes your answer more comprehensive. Analysis is important based on the demand of the question, but do not over analyse.— Underlining keywords gives you an edge over other candidates and enhances presentation of the answer.— Using flowcharts/tree-diagram in the answers saves much time and boosts your score. However, it should be used logically and only where it is required.Way forward/ conclusion— The ending of the answer should be on a positive note and it should have a forward-looking approach. However, if you feel that an important problem must be highlighted, you may add it in your conclusion. Try not to repeat any point from body or introduction.— You may use the findings of reports or surveys conducted at national and international levels, quotes etc. in your answers.Self Evaluation— It is the most important part of our Mains answer writing practice. UPSC Essentials will provide some guiding points or ideas as a thought process that will help you to evaluate your answers.QUESTION 1: Discuss how the concept of Indian Union Territories was developed and implemented.Body:— The issue of language had become a burning factor in the popular sentiment of Independent India by 1948-49.— For instance,(i) The Kannada speakers across the states of Madras, Mysore, Bombay and Hyderabad who had been demanding a separate administrative unit since the late 20th century renewed their movement.(ii) The Marathi and Malayalam speakers both desired respective political units of their own.(iii) Additionally, a distinct Mahagujarat movement had begun. The ultimate spark, however, came from the Andhra statehood movement in the early 1950s.— After the creation of Andhra Pradesh on October 1, 1953, the Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru appointed a States Reorganisation Commission (SRC) to make recommendations to resolve the linguistic problem in India.— The commission comprised of Justice Fazil Ali, KM Panikkar and HN Kunzru. The Commission reported that the “existing structure of the States of the Indian Union” is due to the “growth of the British power in India and the historic process of the integration of former Indian States”.— The Commission submitted its report in September, 1955, recommending the reorganisation of India’s administrative units to form 14 states on linguistic lines and six centrally administered territories. (This was the first time that the term Union Territory (UT) was used)— The original six UTs consisted of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the Laccadive, Minicoy and Amindivi islands (later renamed as Lakshadweep), Delhi, Manipur, Tripura, and Himachal Pradesh.— The character and evolution of Union Territories in India is fascinating, given that there is very little homogeneity among these tiny enclaves spread across the country, other than the fact that they are all administered by the Centre.— Recently, in 2019, Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh became separate Union Territories.Indian states after Independence— This division is reflected in the Constitution of Independent India as Parts A, B, and C.— Part A states included former Governor states such as Bombay and Madras.— States like Mysore and Saurashtra were included in Part B, which had an elected legislature.— The Chief Commissioner was in charge of Part C states such as Delhi and Himachal Pradesh.— Part D states were later established as territories administered by the central government with no provision for a local legislature. This category included only the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.Conclusion:— By The Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956, the territories were declared to be Union Territories.— The five Portuguese territories of Goa, Dadra, Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu were also added to the list of Union Territories after their liberation in 1961.— The Goa, Daman, and Diu Reorganisation Act was passed by Parliament in 1987, granting Goa statehood. Daman and Diu were kept as separate Union Territories.(Source: How the idea of Indian Union Territories was conceived and executed by Adrija Roychowdhury and Srijana Siri)Points to PonderIndian states during the British Rule7th amendment of Constitution of IndiaRelated Previous Year QuestionsThe political and administrative reorganization of states and territories has heen a continuous ongoing process since the mid-nineteenth century. Discuss with examples. (2022)Has the formation of linguistic states strengthened the cause of Indian unity? (2016)QUESTION 2: Why does it rain in southern India in December?Introduction:— North-East (NE) monsoon is associated with the seasonal reversal of surface and lower tropospheric winds, which starts by October.— During the NE monsoon season, the pressure gradient reverses (from land to the Indian Ocean) resulting in northeasterly trade winds, which is the basic state of the system.— The southward movement of the continental tropical convergence zone (CTCZ) and the subtropical anticyclone in the upper troposphere is responsible for the change in surface pressure gradient and lower tropospheric winds.— Therefore, the NE monsoon is often described as the retreating phase of the southwest monsoon.Body:— In southern India, the northeast monsoon is critical for Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Puducherry, Karaikal, coastal Andhra Pradesh, Rayalaseema, and Yanam. Tamil Nadu receives nearly 48% of total annual rainfall (443.3mm) from October to December, which is critical for rabi cultivation.— NE monsoon is relatively dry, stable and has less vertical extend compared to the southwest monsoon.— The NE monsoon rainfall varies from diurnal to synoptic, intra-seasonal to inter-annual time scales.— The inter-annual variability of the NE monsoon rainfall has an impact on agricultural production and water resources throughout south peninsular India.— South Asia also experiences many extreme weather events during the NE monsoon season, such as heavy rain, strong winds, and floods.Recent Examples— The annual rainfall of India’s southernmost district, Kanyakumari, is 760mm, whereas the district has already recorded 1050.7mm during October 1 – December 20, 2023.— The India Meteorological Department (IMD) stated that Thoothkudi, Tirunelveli and Kanyakumari districts of Tamil Nadu had received about 100 per cent or more surplus rain during these three days over the previous week (December 6 – 13, 2023).— In 2015, the city of Chennai experienced deluge in 2015, which resulted significant loss of life and property.Conclusion:— In India, the NE monsoon season (Oct-Dec) contributes about 11% of its annual rainfall over the country as a whole.— In comparison to the northern parts of the country, the south peninsula receives significantly more rainfall. During this season, many districts on the south peninsula receive 30-60% of their annual rainfall.— South Peninsular India’s water resources and agricultural output are impacted by the NE monsoon rainfall’s interannual variability.(Source: Why Tamil Nadu has witnessed heavy rainfall in December 2023 by Anjali Marar, mausam.imd.gov.in)Points to PonderITCZENSODifference between south-western and north-eastern monsoonCyclone MichaungRelated Previous Year QuestionsWhy is the South-West Monsoon called ‘Purvaiya’ (easterly) in Bhojpur Region?

"Friday, Dec 29, 2023","Rajesh Khanna: The OG ‘King of Romance’ who irked Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Yash Chopra with his ‘starry tantrums’",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/rajesh-khanna-the-og-king-of-romance-who-irked-hrishikesh-mukherjee-yash-chopra-with-his-starry-tantrums-9087700/,"‘Zindagi kaisi hai paheli, kabhi toh hasaaye, kabhi ye rulaaye’There couldn’t have been a better song written for Rajesh Khanna – the handsome, twinkle-eyed heart-stealer of late 1960s and 1970s Hindi cinema. With his boy-next-door looks, chivalry and his swoon-worthy romantic actions, he robbed the audience of critical thinking and charmed them, especially women, with his roles of a lover. He came at a time when the audience was done revering middle-aged heroes (Rajendra Kumar, Dilip Kumar) and wanted a new generation actor to express their dreams and desires onscreen. Not just youngsters, but even the older generation lapped up this storehouse of talent.“In all my films, people identified strongly with my character. Every college girl wanted a boyfriend like me, every mother wanted her son to be like me, and every sister wanted her brother to be like me. All the married women dreamt of a husband like me. Together, they made Rajesh Khanna the screen idol that he was,” the actor had said in a 1989 interview.Also read | Mohammed Rafi: The ‘Man of God’ who made a star out of Shammi Kapoor; promised Rajiv Gandhi free shows to help Kishore KumarRajesh Khanna was unlike today’s stars. He didn’t have a well-built physique or looks that would stop people in their tracks, yet he managed to turn heads as he brought a stamp of class and sensitivity to his characters. Moviegoers connected with him as he conveyed their emotional vulnerabilities on screen with the utmost sincerity and passion. Hrishikesh Mukherjee, as actor Rakhee told Etimes, believed, “Nobody can compete with Rajesh Khanna. It is impossible. He wasn’t there for his body and height but just for his face, smile and eyes.”While he did impress with his initial films like Aakhri Khat (1966), Raaz (1967) and Baharon Ke Sapne (1967), Khanna came to his own and became invincible with Aradhana (1969), Do Raaste (1969), Ittefaq (1969), Safar (1970), Kati Patang (1971), Khamoshi (1969), and several others. Actor Deepti Naval, who watched Khanna’s Aradhana thirteen times with her sister, told Scroll, “He was the dream man of every girl. I felt no other actor could have done ‘Roop tera mastana’ like Rajesh Khanna, treading a fine line between forbidden love and desire…” Naval and her sister even wore a Guru kurta to watch his film Safar. “We were that crazy about Rajesh Khanna.” Not just the actor and her sister, millions of girls were in love with the ‘superstar’. He used to receive fan mail in abundance, some of which were supposedly written in blood. His car would be covered in lipstick marks wherever it was parked.Also read | Revisiting Bawarchi and Rajesh Khanna’s uncomplicated simplicitySharmila Tagore said in an interview with The Indian Express, “Women came out in droves to see Kaka (Khanna). They would stand in queues outside the studios to catch a glimpse. They would marry his photographs, and they would pull at his clothes. Delhi girls were crazier for him than Mumbai girls. He needed police protection when he was in public. I have never seen anything like this before and since.”Born Jatin Khanna, on December 29, 1942, in Amritsar, Punjab, the actor was brought up by foster parents, Chunnilal and Leelawati Khanna, and he never spoke of his biological parents. He was a much-pampered kid who attended Mumbai’s St Sebastian Goan High School, where he became friends with Ravi Kapoor, who later gained popularity as Jeetendra. After completing his studies at Kishinchand Chelleram College, Khanna, who was already doing theatre, decided to pursue acting. He approached several filmmakers with his pictures but got no response from them. But Khanna’s struggle story was a little different from others as he came from a well-to-do family that was willing to support him financially. Gautam Chintamani’s biography on the actor mentioned that he “drove to auditions in a car and had a monthly allowance of Rs 10,000.”In 1965, he was presented with a unique opportunity as some of the famous producers and directors from the Hindi film industry, including BR Chopra, Guru Dutt, and Bimal Roy, organised a talent contest along with Filmfare to find a new face for the film industry.Also read | Dimple Kapadia: A versatile performer who has redefined portrayal of older womenRajesh Khanna beat 10,000 contestants and won the 1965 All India Talent Contest organised by United Producers and Filmfare. The talent hunt contract specified that 12 different producers would sign the winner for 12 films. Hence, a golden chance to rise to stardom. The first film he signed was GP Sippy’s Raaz and subsequently, Chetan Anand approached him for Aakhri Khat. Though he was happy to have gotten two films early in his career, what bothered him was the call time for Raaz, which was 9 am. He told Bhawana Somaya for ‘Echoes of an Era’, “Now, waking up early is just not my style. I am not an early bird. From childhood, I have always risen late. My mother wouldn’t allow anyone to enter my room and disturb me. So when the director told me about attending shooting early in the morning, my heart sank.”On the day of the shoot, Khanna arrived at 11 am and instead of being apologetic, he hit back at a senior team member who questioned his behaviour despite being a newcomer, “To hell with the career and to hell with this film. My lifestyle cannot change for my career.” This remained the actor’s attitude throughout his career, as confirmed by Prem Chopra in one of his interviews. “Rajesh Khanna was a great actor, but he had this habit of reaching late all the time. Not everyone would take it when he landed late on sets. Hours after everyone reached and got ready, he would reach the sets.” Even in her latest appearance on Koffee With Karan, when Sharmila Tagore was asked to describe Khanna in two words, she replied, “Perpetually late.”However, filmmakers grew habitual of Khanna’s habit of always turning up late and continued to cast him for his impeccable screen presence. The actor holds the record of delivering 17 consecutive super-hits in three years from 1969-71, which included 15 successive solo super-hit films, starting with Ittefaq (1969) and Aradhana (1969). Ramesh Deo, who played Dr Prakash in Anand, recalled that Khanna was perpetually late on the sets of Anand, and this would infuriate Hrishikesh Mukherjee. But as soon as he saw what the actor did in front of the camera, his anger would melt away. In a 2012 conversation with DNA, Deo said, “Rajesh used to enact the scene so well, that after the scene, Hrishi-da used to say, ‘Tumne itna aacha kam kiya hai, tumhare sau gunah maaf (You have done such good work that all your sins are forgiven).’”By the time Anand released in 1971, Khanna had reached the pinnacle of success and had become a ‘phenomenon’. The mass hysteria around him remains unbeatable to this day. In fact, at one point, he himself felt, “next to God”.“He was the biggest star ever. From 1969 to 1975, the high that he touched became a benchmark that nobody could breach. You could identify with him. He had a very charming smile. He had a good voice and he also got really good music. When a person’s stars start working in his favour, then he gets support from every sphere,” screenwriter Salim Khan once said about Khanna to BBC.Also read | Rajesh Khanna’s obsession with death and his songs that celebrated mystery of lifeHowever, by the mid-seventies, Rajesh Khanna’s hold over the box office had begun to slip, increasing his insecurities. He only wished to be surrounded by people who praised him, and those who spoke anything which was not favourable to him became his enemy. His starry tantrums were no longer taken by filmmakers and he was once reportedly slapped by Mehmood when he was directing him in Janta Hawaldar. Yash Chopra also couldn’t handle his “superstar tantrums on a regular basis”. In 1973, when Khanna worked with the emerging star Amitabh Bachchan, he believed nobody could replace him. Actor Asrani recalled in a 2018 interview with Filmfare, “There was a basic courtesy between the two but Rajesh suffered from a superiority complex. He believed ‘no one can shake me. I am too powerful.’ Throughout the film, there was palpable tension between the two.”The dried-up offers were also a result of Khanna’s unwillingness to reinvent himself. “He continued the same style and those films did not work either. That is why he had to (suffer a downfall). He could not face that thing – where I was and where I am now,” Prem Chopra had said while explaining the superstar’s downfall from the numer-uno position.The failure led him to alcoholism and one night after drinking, he started yelling from the terrace of his Mumbai bungalow, Ashirvaad. This was the phase of Khanna’s career when he had seven consecutive flops. “One after another, seven films had just flopped in a row. It was raining, pitch-dark and up there alone on my terrace, I lost control. I yelled out. ‘Parvardigar, hum garibon ka itna sakt imtihan na le ki hum tere vajood ko inkar kar de (God, don’t test my patience to such an extent that I question your very existence).’ Of course, Dimple (Kapadia, his wife) and my staff came running, thinking that I had gone insane. It was because success hit me so much that I couldn’t take the failure,” he shared with Movie Magazine in 1990.One of the actor’s dialogues from Daag (1973) sums up the ups and downs of his life, which he later recreated on the stage at an event with much of the film industry in attendance, “Izzatein, shohratein, ulfatein, chahatein, sab kuch iss duniya mein rehta nahin/ Aaj main hun jahan kal koi aur tha/ Ye bhi ek daur hai woh bhi ek daur tha. (Nothing is permanent in life. somebody else was here where I am today).” A day came in Khanna’s life when he, who once felt “next to God”, thought of himself to be a ‘dog’.Also read | Rajesh Khanna’s best friend remembers actor’s last day: ‘Akshay Kumar and I were by his feet, Dimple Kapadia was near his daughters’He told Filmfare, “I used to ask my man Prashant to tell the caller that Kaka is having a bath and call up again just to feign importance and attend to the call only when the caller called up four times. God punished me and a time came when I used to stand next to the phone hoping that I would get a call. And when one day a call came, I picked the receiver and said,’ Kaka here,’ and then came the reply, ‘Kaun Kaka? Wrong Number.’ That was when I realized that I was not GOD but DOG.”Rajesh Khanna continued to work in the 80s, but unlike the early 1970s, he failed to pull people to cinema halls. One of the last notable roles that he did was in Rishi Kapoor’s Aa Ab Laut Chelein in 1999.At the peak of his career, Khanna married 16-year-old Dimple Kapadia, whom he met on a flight to Ahmedabad. The two got married six months before Kapadia’s Bobby released. But Kapadia knew her marriage with the superstar wouldn’t last long from the moment she stepped into his house. On The Pritish Nandy Show, the actor said she could not understand the superstar. Revisiting the pre-separation phase of her life, Kapadia said, “I think we were two very different kinds of people. I was probably very young to understand what was happening to this man, who was a superstar. I have never been able to understand stars and their behaviour pattern at all because I am not one myself. I just couldn’t understand.”The duo separated in 1982 and have two daughters – Twinkle Khanna, who was born in 1974, and Rinkie Khanna, born in 1977.Before marrying Dimple, Rajesh Khanna was in a seven-year-long relationship with Anju Mahendru. When he married Kapadia, he deliberately made his baraat parade before Anju’s house. After separating from Kapadia, he also got involved with Tina Munim, who allegedly left him because he didn’t divorce Kapadia.Journalist Bhawana Somaaya summarised Khanna’s life in a Screen article which was published in 1987: “Rajesh Khanna became more rigid and withdrew into his shell. If Anju couldn’t cope with his success, Dimple couldn’t cope with his failure.”But, all the people he was close to returned to him during his last days, including Dimple Kapadia and her daughter, and Anju Mahendru. He was admitted to Mumbai’s Lilavati Hospital due to prolonged illness, but he insisted on dying in his bedroom. The family brought him back to Aashirvaad and tried to lift his spirit by saying that he will be well soon. But Khanna knew it was time on July 18, 2012.

He said the profit can be figured out only after 6-7 years, depending on the Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) market at that time.While strongly defending the controversial project in the reserved area, Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Commissioner Shekhar Singh on Thursday remained silent as to how much the builder will benefit through the project by way of Amenity TDR (Transfer of Development Rights).”Like what the Municipal Commissioner said, I too want to state that there is nothing illegal in the project. If they want, they can scrap the project. But there is no scam at all. If I make profit out of this project, it will be mine. If there is loss, then I will have to suffer. There is uncertainty over my profit,” Aditya Javadekar, the developer and director of Vilas Javadekar Infinity Developers Ltd, told The Indian Express.Javadekar said that, at this stage, nothing can be said about the profit. ”The cost of the project is Rs 570 crore. I will be putting the entire amount into the project. The project is expected to be completed in around three-and-a-half years. The TDR is released in a phased manner as per the progress of the construction. After the project is completed, the full TDR is released after the ‘defect liability time’ or the warranty period. As the TDR is released as the work progresses, it can be used by me in my projects or I can sell it to other builders,” he said.Javadekar said he will be investing Rs 570 crore as per the PCMC tender in the project and is expecting to get Rs 1,100 crore worth of TDR.”I expect Rs 1,100 crore worth TDR in 6-7 years. But this is uncertain. If you consider the value of this amount after 7 years, I might just get between Rs 600-700 crore which is the normal 10-15 per cent profit. This is what the contractor’s margin is in 6-7 years. This is similar to the toll collected by contractors over a period of 20 years,” he explained, adding that the toll contractor makes the road and then gets the amount in 20 years.Javadekar said the value of TDR of Rs 1,100 crore is completely in an uncertain zone and his profit is based on TDR market price which is always uncertain.“However, if I sell the TDR, it will depend on the market condition. And in this case, it is after 7 years. I might have to sell the TDR at a discount or at a premium rate. The amount might become Rs 600 crore if I sell it at a discount or might go up to Rs 1,500 crore if it is sold at a premium. In 7-8 years, the market will go up and down. Therefore I cannot expect how much I will get. It is all conjecture… I might gain some amount or might suffer loss as well depending on the TDR market,” the builder remarked.Javadekar said, ”If I were to get TDR at one go, I would have told you the profit. But I will be getting TDR over a period of at least 7 years”.

A lot of people throng the coastal state especially during this time of the year to celebrate the New Year’s Eve.However, the behaviour of tourists, who sometimes break laws, leaves a bad taste and invites the ire of locals. In the past, there have been incidents of tourists driving their cars onto beaches. Now, a video is going viral showing a man driving an SUV while his children are apparently “sleeping” on the car’s roof. A local resident also confronted the man on why he was putting his children at risk with such an act.The Mahindra XUV 700 with a Telangana number plate has two kids lying down on the car’s roof.
“Excuse me, you are making these children sleep on top of the car,” the local is heard confronting the man who is driving the SUV. However, he doesn’t take his question seriously and nonchalantly continues driving and says he is taking a right turn. The video of the incident was posted on X, formerly Twitter, by the page In Goa 24×7 (@InGoa24x7).Watch the video below:#Shocking– Tourist let his kids sleep on the roof of SUV on Parra coconut tree road! pic.twitter.com/boeFt2vRdo— In Goa 24×7 (@InGoa24x7) December 27, 2023“Some how several tourists (Indians as well as foreigners) coming to Goa have this wrong impression that everything is allowed in Goa.

I confronted him – he was throwing unopened biscuit packs. I told him that he should get down, open the packs and not litter.

It constituted 10 per cent of the total share of registered vehicles. According to the Deputy RTO, Sanjiv Bhor, rising awareness on green energy and tax benefits were the main reasons why a large section of people switched to e-vehicles in Pune. “People have also realised the tax benefits that they get from electric vehicle purchases. The 100 per cent tax exemption for purchasing electric vehicles has encouraged people to use more and more EVs,” said Bhor. He added that the increase in the number of charging stations and manufacturing companies had made it easier for motorists to move with the trend of EVs.According to an official, there are defined criteria for categorising EVs as vehicles or otherwise. The data from the RTO excludes e-bikes with less than 250 watts of power and run with speed below 25 mph. Such bikes are exempted from requiring a licence and registration.

The court reduced the sentence on Thursday.“We congratulate the Union government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for making efforts to commute the death sentence of the Indian Navy officials in Qatar.

completed their sentences in jails according to Indian laws. If an Islamic country like Qatar can be convinced to commute the death sentence, then why can’t the Indian government take a sympathetic view of Sikh prisoners,” he asked.“India is a democratic country and calls itself the country of Mahatma Gandhi. Whenever someone assumes an important office in the government, that person goes to Raj Ghat to pay homage to Mahatma Gandhi. At the same time, respective governments have not followed the spirit of the law in the case of Sikh prisoners, who have completed their sentences but are still in jail. The death sentence of Balwant Singh Rajoana has not been commuted yet despite mentioning the same in the notification issued on the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji. Why can’t the government take a sympathetic view of Sikh prisoners as it did for the officials convicted under serious charges in Qatar?”“If the Qatar government can commute the death sentence of foreigners, then the Indian government should also not be rigid towards the demands of SGPC over Sikh prisoners. The central government issued a notification to commute his death sentence to life imprisonment on the eve of the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak,” Grewal told The Indian Express.

Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma was also present.Terming it as a “golden day” for the people of Assam, Home Minister Amit Shah said the state has suffered for long due to violence by ULFA and around 10,000 people have lost their lives since 1979.He further announced that a major development package will be given to Assam under the agreement with ULFA and assured that the accord will be implemented fully.“It is a matter of great joy for me that today is a golden day for Assam’s future.

Along with Mishra, who is the government’s adviser on Northeast affairs, Intelligence Bureau’s Director Tapan Deka was part of the talks with the group.The pro-talks faction of ULFA, a separatist outfit, was founded in 1979 by a group of 20 youngsters from Upper Assam districts to wage an armed struggle for an independent Assam.The group had expressed willingness for talks on several occasions but had been firm on its stand on ‘sovereignty’.During the Assembly election campaigns in Tripura, Meghalaya, and Nagaland earlier this year, the BJP emphasised the decline in militancy and the relative peace in the Northeast since the Narendra Modi government came to power in 2014.

Phoenix Mall of Asia in Hebbal and Phoenix Marketcity in Whitefield, which became prime targets, were left with no choice but to stop their operations for a day.The Phoenix Mall of Asia said in a statement, “The Phoenix Mall of Asia reaffirms its commitment to adherence to state rules and regulations by incorporating Kannada signage at the mall’s premises. This strategic initiative not only underscores the mall’s dedication to comply but also reflects the respect for the cultural context of the region. The inclusion of Kannada signage is a testament to our commitment to operate within the legal framework and align with local guidelines. The Phoenix Mall of Asia remains steadfast in upholding ethical business practices and regulatory compliances, further enhancing the overall experience for our patrons. The Phoenix Mall of Asia believes that this approach not only contributes to the seamless operation of the mall but also fosters a deeper connection with the community they serve.”Although the loss incurred due to the protest has not been ascertained, an insider of the retail industry told The Indian Express that it could run into several crores of rupees as it was a business season. “We did not expect such attacks on businesses. Even if there was a protest, we anticipated that police would provide enough security. But what happened later was disappointing. Some of the shops’ name boards and other interiors were vandalised while police watched as mute spectators,” the industry insider said.Speaking to The Indian Express, Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, president of the Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said, “It was really unfortunate that police could not protect businesses. Bengaluru is a globally noted city. We are speaking about ‘Brand Bengaluru’ and if the government doesn’t act against such attacks, how can we even promote it?” he said.“The government has set the rules and given a deadline till February 28, 2024. We have urged all business establishments to abide by that. But that doesn’t allow anyone to take law into their own hands,” he added.The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike has issued a circular stating that all the commercial establishments in the city must have Kannada name boards by February 28, 2024.Retail establishments either not sporting Kannada name boards prominently or not at all suffered losses in many parts including the central business district of Bengaluru. Soon after the incident Gautam Jain, director (advocacy) of the Retailers Association of India, said in a letter to Chief Secretary Rajneesh Goel, “While we fully acknowledge and respect the cultural sentiments of Karnataka and importance of promoting the Kannada language, we would like to highlight that our member retailers have always been committed to honouring local culture and made efforts to comply with Kannada signage on name boards.”With regard to the rule mandating 60 per cent Kannada content on name boards, the association has requested the government to give industries time till February.Abhishek Agarwal, who runs a consultancy which is into building artificial intelligence tools, said he had shifted his AI consulting firm from Pune to Bengaluru because of regional chauvinism in the city in Maharashtra. “We’re a team of 70 people now and, as a company, pay our fair share of taxes to the Karnataka government. Our team comes from all parts of India and calls Bangalore their home. We also contribute in our own individual capacity to the development of the city by spending and taxation,” he said.“I know a few Kannada words but rarely use them in my day-to-day life. The only languages I know are English, Hindi and Odia. I don’t mind learning Kannada but definitely wouldn’t learn if I’m forced. I’d rather contemplate moving elsewhere if this unabated hooliganism continues. We’re already tolerating terrible traffic, sh*tty infra and unclean neighbourhoods. Is living in peace too much to ask for?” he said.Former Infosys board member Mohandas Pai wrote on X, “@CPBlr @siddaramaiah @CMofKarnataka @DKShivakumar How can police not stop such violence and vandalism? @kiranshaw @rk_misra @krishnabgowda @kris_sg Why is our Minister for Bengaluru @DKShivakumar on whom we have high hopes quiet? We need confidence boosting measures from govt.”Biocon chief Kiran Mazumdar Shaw posted, “This soft handed approach by Police is very troubling. These are professional paid vandals – it’s so obvious. @DKShivakumar please take action and keep our city safe @BPACofficial.”Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar said, “Everyone can protest in a democracy but we will not tolerate anyone taking the law into their hands. I am very much disturbed that they have vandalised many boards and shops. They can use black flags, raise slogans and ask the government to implement the order.”For his part, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said on Thursday, “Kannada is supreme in Karnataka. But if someone goes against the law, the government will not tolerate it.”Speaking after chairing a meeting about the implementation of the 60 per cent-Kannada rule for signage, he said, “According to the circular (dated 24 March 2018 ), it is 60 per cent in Kannada and 40 per cent in other languages. However, when the bylaw was amended, it became 50-50. So in the meeting it has been decided to modify it to 60-40 per cent, and I have directed officials to bring in an ordinance. All commercial establishments will have to abide by February 28, 2024, and I think I have made myself very clear.”

Oil prices, on the other hand, fell by 10 per cent during the year, which could ease inflationary pressure and support the operating performance of the corporates.“We feel that though the outlook on broader indexes is moderate in the short to medium term, the large caps will maintain their vibrancy due to strong earnings growth and in anticipation of the continuation of premium valuation,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.In Asian markets, Tokyo settled lower while Shanghai and Hong Kong ended with gains.

"Friday, Dec 29, 2023","‘Don't know my destiny, but at least I tried': Deepika Kumari’s Korea journey to fight back from anonymity ",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/sport-others/dont-know-my-destiny-but-atleast-i-tried-deepika-kumaris-korea-journey-to-fightback-from-anonymity-9086766/,"For some of India’s top stars, 2023 was the year when they had to pause, reflect and reboot. In some cases, to recover from injuries; in a few others, to rediscover lost form. All in the hope that when the big day comes, they’ll be ready and recharged for the challengeGoesan, in the heart of South Korea, is as nondescript a county as they come. It doesn’t have the hustle or the nightlife of Seoul, roughly 200 km away. Neither is it a transport hub like Incheon, nor the tourist magnate that Busan is.It has, in the last few years, come to be known for something quite unfortunate – as the symbol of South Korea’s shrinking population. A mountain town that, with a third of its population aged above 65 and amidst falling birthrates, is at the risk of vanishing.But there’s one thing that keeps Goesan-gun going; a global attraction for which the steady stream of visitors hike up the hill hoping to rediscover themselves in a town that advertises itself as the ‘healing hub’ of South Korea.These aren’t any normal tourists. They are Olympic and World Champion archers who land up there seeking refuge at the Kim Hyung Tak Archery School. If South Korea is the mecca of world archery, Kim Hyung Tak – or ‘coach Kim’, as he is fondly called – is its highest priest.Last month, Coach Kim had an Indian visitor – Deepika Kumari.***Still breathing a little heavy after a training session, Deepika is talking about the ‘biggest sacrifice’ she’s had to make so far in her 29 years on the planet: to leave her 10-month-old daughter at home and travel to Goesan.“It was a very tough decision,” she says. “But I felt I had no other choice.”She doesn’t say it but this could well be her last throw of the dice. A sort of all-or-nothing moment that could define the remainder of her career.For, Deepika knows that if she doesn’t finish in the top eight at the Open Selection Trials in Kolkata next month, her return to the national team will be further prolonged. That could deal another blow to her ambitions of making the cut for the Paris Olympics in July. And Deepika is desperate to be there to make amends for all her previous misses.There are stories of unfulfilled promises and then there’s the story of Deepika Kumari.Without a doubt one of India’s finest recurve archers, she is a former world number 1, a former joint world record holder, a multiple world and continental medallist and a National Sports Award winner. But also the one who has fallen consistently short on big stages, the Olympics in particular. At London 2012, she exited in the first round. Four years later in Rio, Deepika bowed out in the Round of 16 and at the postponed Tokyo Games, she lost in the quarterfinals.After Tokyo, her career has hit the proverbial nadir. Dropped from the government’s Target Olympic Podium Scheme, which supports an athlete’s training and competition requirements. And dropped from the national team, too, after she was unable to finish in the top eight during the selection trials this year.“I wanted to return to the national team. That’s why, after I gave birth to my child on December 8 (last year), I was back training on January 10,” she says.***She calls it a phase that was ‘beautiful’ but also ‘boring’; a journey in ‘self exploration’ but also one that drove her ‘mad’.“Sometimes,” Deepika says, “I used to tell Atanu, ‘mujhe teer chalana hai nahi toh mein mental hospital mein bharti ho jaungi.’ (I want to shoot an arrow, else I’ll have to admit myself in a mental hospital).”Deepika continued shooting until the sixth month of her pregnancy, when things got a little complicated and she had to take a step back from playing sport. For someone who has been on the move for more than half of her life, staying still was an alien, frustrating experience.“A sportsperson’s life is a constant adventure. You are travelling, competing, dealing with pressure, winning, losing. Something or the other constantly keeps happening,” she says. “And then to sit still suddenly, it was boring.”Deepika’s first attempt to return to the national team did not go as planned as ‘an error’ in the second selection trial saw her drop out of the top eight, extending her international exile.Watching her daughter grow up, taking her first steps and ‘learning something new every day’ filled the vacuum created by the sudden absence of travel and competition. At that point, the Paris Olympics might have seemed a little out of sight but they never were out of her mind.With time running out to get in shape for January’s national team selection trials – the first step towards the Paris Games – she decided to travel to South Korea.***One of the first things Deepika told Coach Kim upon reaching Goesan was, ‘I do not know anything.’To reinvent herself, she first had to give up some of her old habits. “If I have to act illiterate to gain from the knowledge others possess, I am ready to do that. I told him (coach Kim), ‘I don’t know anything, you teach me. Teach me the right thing.’”When she went in November, the Indian had three-time Olympic gold medallist Park Sung-hyun, regarded as the best female archer of this century, and her husband, Olympic champion and another legend of the sport, Park Kyung-mo, for company.“After reaching there I got to know that every top player in the world has, at some point, trained at coach Kim’s academy,” says the athlete supported by the Olympic Gold Quest.The long list comprises many Indians, including the likes of Tarundeep Rai and Deepika’s husband Atanu Das, upon whose insistence she went there.Kim is hailed as the first coach to lead South Korea’s national team to world archery’s pinnacle. The archers he’s trained have been winning world and Olympic titles since the late 1970s and early 80s, starting with Young Sook Park, who won two gold medals at the World Championship in 1979 followed by the Olympic title that Hyang Soon Seo clinched in 1984.Coach Kim, the author of the book that’s considered the sport’s bible, is often the first and last word on all things archery. For Deepika, this was apparent within hours of training at his school. “I learnt so many things, some of which no one in India had taught me before,” Deepika says.She adds: “If I had gone there thinking I knew things, I wouldn’t be able to learn anything new. Had I told him I have won whatever I have because of my existing techniques and methods, then there was no point going all the way there. So, it was essential to go with an open mind and surrender myself to his ideas.”Deepika found herself in an environment where she could talk about her technical problems and fears while competing openly, ‘without being judged’. In three weeks, Coach Kim worked on her grip, swing, finger placement and form, how she stands while shooting. Those 21 days helped her to adapt to the new techniques, which she now uses in training daily.“It should hopefully reflect in my scores,” she says.“Things like setting the anchor. He’d give examples of eating with a knife and fork. The correct way to use them is by holding with just three fingers and relaxing the fourth. He used that parallel with pulling the string,” she says. “We pull the string with three fingers, so what’s the use of the other two? Not much, you’d think. But it’s all about how to keep them relaxed, what position, where… all these little things have an impact on how well you shoot.”Kim used an app he’d developed to analyse the body balance and movement while shooting, gave her tips to regain strength after childbirth and also conquering her fears.“We spoke about things that were bothering me mentally. Like getting out of the team, losing… there isn’t any one particular thing,” Deepika says. “He told me just one thing: If I’m out, I’m out. It’s not like you’re dying. There will be another chance.”Deep down, though, Deepika knows another chance is something she might not get so easily. “I don’t know what’s in my destiny,” she says. “But at least I have tried.”BOXOut of the team: In January this year, Deepika returned to domestic competition after maternity break. Already dropped from the Target Olympic Podium Scheme after the Tokyo Olympics, Deepika could not finish in the top 8 at the selection trials. Thus, one of India’s most decorated recurve archers found herself out of the national team.Reboot: She spent the whole year on the fringes before winning two gold and one silver medal at the National Games in Goa last month. Soon after, she went to South Korea, where she trained under legendary coach Kim Hyung-Tak at his school in Goesan. Deepika says Kim has worked on multiple facets of her game, including form, posture and grip, which should improve her scores.What next: The first selection trials will be held in January and archers who finish in the top 8 will be called to the national camp. The teams for international competitions, including Olympic qualifying events, will be selected from these eight players. It means if she does not make it to the top 8, her Olympic ambitions will take a severe hit.

"Friday, Dec 29, 2023",South Africa vs India: Visitors blown away at Centurion as neither bowlers nor batsmen come to the party in innings defeat inside three days ,https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ind-vs-sa-1st-test-nandre-burger-stars-with-4-as-south-africa-demolish-india-by-an-innings-and-32-runs-9086344/,"Amidst the ruins that went by the name of the Indian batting at SuperSport Park, Virat Kohli stood alone. His head slumped, his eyes blank, his movements frozen, his mind unable to process the rapid unravelling, his colleagues scattered astray like a loft of pigeons upon a gunshot, as India stumbled to an innings-and-32-run defeat. A veteran of 111 Tests, even he would struggle to recollect a capitulation of such flaky, abysmal nature, where they displayed little skill or courage to fight on, where they were drab, disjointed and directionless. Kohli alone raged against the dying light, against the darkness that had shrouded his team, with a delectable 76, but he was alone and helpless.In three days, the quest for the final frontier fell apart, the elusive shore would remain seductively distant. Worse, this time, they did not reach anywhere in the vicinity of the shore, shipwrecked in the middle of the ocean, sunk tracelessly. It was like them equipping and desiring to scale a peak and then huffing and puffing at the base camp itself.Cape Town, the venue of the next Test, would give them time to meditate under the magnificent Table Mountains. Until they reach the tip of Africa, hollowness and not regret would seize and shred them.That’s that from the Test at Centurion.South Africa win by an innings and 32 runs, lead the series 1-0.Scorecard – https://t.co/032B8Fmvt4 #SAvIND pic.twitter.com/Sd7hJSxqGK— BCCI (@BCCI) December 28, 2023The usual when-and-where-it-all-went-wrong probe would hit empty notes. Because a lot went wrong, and went wrong fast. Test-match days in South Africa can progress rapidly, a reason a lot of Tests don’t see a fifth day. The moment South Africa mustered a lead of 163 on a track that could progressively deteriorate, the end notes of the game had begun to chime. To salvage even a draw from this game seemed tough. But it was not a graveyard of wickets as someone who would see the scorecard without watching the game would assume.There were good balls. This is South Africa; this is Centurion; this is Test cricket. There would be good balls. But Rohit Sharma alone perished to a semi-devilish ball. The delivery from Kagiso Rabada was a bolter; a rhyme tuned to a note-perfect beat. The line, angle, length, the nip away, every facet was perfectly measured. The rest of the batsmen were largely their own agents of chaos, victims of their own incompetence.Shubman Gill, touted the brightest young talent in the world, showed he is still a work in progress in this format, his dismissal bearing from naivety as much as vanity. He had spanked a few fours off Marco Jansen, but at this level, in seaming conditions, all it takes is a ball. He was playing the bowler and not the ball, and played all around a staple full ball to get bowled.Yashasvi Jaiswal, dropped off the first ball of the innings, discounted the unnerving bounce of the surface. His inflexibility to move his hands away from the leaping ball would continue to be exploited.A valiant 76 by Virat Kohli showed why this format is the ultimate test!The very innings that made every 🇮🇳 believe till the end 😍Will he continue his form in the next test as well?Tune-in to #SAvIND 2nd Test
JAN 3, 12:30 PM | Star Sports Network#Cricket pic.twitter.com/KpH9s53znc— Star Sports (@StarSportsIndia) December 28, 2023His Mumbai teammate Shreyas Iyer has the shots to make runs even in hostile conditions, but might not possess the bloody-mindedness. He drove loosely at a good-length Jansen ball soon after the tea break. A few balls earlier, he had seen the slips-man dropping a simple catch, off an edge that resulted from his trying to reach out for a wide ball. Counter-attacking is a wise tactic, but not when the circumstances demand to support a senior batsman in twinkling, determined form. It was the moment to glean from the doctrine of patience; but instead Iyer chose the manual of self-destruction.Procession continuesSuch heady implosions could spread like a highly-contagious malaise. Even the usually game-sensible KL Rahul could not resist the temptation to drive at a full ball from Nandre Burger that deviated a wee bit when it made contact with his bat. Again, the drive was loose and tentative, away from the body. At 96 for 5, and soon 105 for 7, Rohit Sharma’s men knew the end was imminent. Only that, it came soon, sparing them from a long suffering. India’s second innings resistance lasted merely 34.1 overs.A feeling worse than losing the game was the consciousness that they would lose the game. India let this feeling stew them in the first session itself. When the morning began, India were not out of the game yet. A stream of wickets in the morning would bring them back into the contest. South Africa’s lead was, after all, a meagre 11. And South Africa would bat last with a specialist batsman less.After a great World Cup with the ball, #MarcoJanses showed his prowess with the bat, helping #SouthAfrica stretch their lead to 163.How will #TeamIndia respond with the bat?Tune-in to #SAvIND 1st Test,
LIVE NOW | Star Sports Network pic.twitter.com/zd6wc4BOhg— Star Sports (@StarSportsIndia) December 28, 2023But India lost their belief in less than an hour. Mohammed Siraj and Jasprit Bumrah did bowl with heart and skill, but without fortune. But rather than persisting, they whined about their lack of luck and resigned to their fate even before the match had drifted away from them. The energy on the field dissipated; the bowling turned flaccid, leaked boundaries in bounty. They waited for a moment of inspiration; a kiss of life. But nothing arrived.Imagination deserted; ideas struck woefully late, drawing serious concerns over their planning and home work. Dean Elgar has a weakness against short-pitched bowling from over the stumps. He would succumb to the leg-side short-ball ploy. But by that time, Elgar had scored 185 runs. They persisted with this method, but Jansen would plunder more runs. To endure a poor day of cricket was excusable, but to experience two successive bad days for a world-class team is lamentable.This Team Though 😍🇿🇦A Fairytale ending at SuperSport Park for The Dean🧚‍♀️ #WozaNawe #BePartOfIt #SAvIND pic.twitter.com/w7N89WkHyu— Proteas Men (@ProteasMenCSA) December 28, 2023Often, teams make good use of overnight breaks. The players themselves would get a better perspective of what went wrong, the video analysts and coaches would share their inputs too. But India did not take the hard lessons of Day Two. They kept repeating the same foibles, like running on repeat mode. It was baffling, as over the last decade India have built a reputation of fighting back from crises, bouncing back strongly to reverse the tide. But this time, they stood frozen, letting the waves of ineptitude swallow them.At the presentation ceremony, a devastated Rohit had neither the heart nor the words to sum up the reasons for the defeat. He spat out platitudes: “Not good enough.” “We didn’t adapt well.” “Bowlers, they haven’t played much here.” He vouched to make a comeback in Cape Town. History supports them too — in absolute duress, they have summoned the belief to make stirring comebacks. But the final frontier would remain unconquered, the shores of Africa continue to seductively elude India.

"Friday, Dec 29, 2023","'Don’t forget what we did in Australia and England with our batting,' Rohit Sharma on where batsmen and bowlers went wrong ",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/dont-forget-what-we-did-in-australia-england-with-batting-rohit-sharma-india-vs-south-africa-1st-test-9086835/,"Rohit Sharma was careful in the immediate aftermath of a disastrous Test to not blame his bowlers or criticise his batsmen. He tried his best to maintain his composure first during the post-match ceremony and later at the media conference – – but a couple of observations did pop out eventually. He didn’t take umbrage at the criticism or lose his composure but there was a moment when he gently reminded how well the batting unit has done in the past. “Don’t forget what we did in Australia and England- we did well with our batting. Sometimes, these kinds of performances happen. It’s not as if we don’t know how to bat outside India. Sometimes, the opposition plays better than us. That’s my thought. It’s not about how many overs they played and how many we played. In the last four tours, go look at how we performed,” Rohit told reporters. That's that from the Test at Centurion.South Africa win by an innings and 32 runs, lead the series 1-0.Scorecard – https://t.co/032B8Fmvt4 #SAvIND pic.twitter.com/Sd7hJSxqGK— BCCI (@BCCI) December 28, 2023Was the batting failure down to technical issues, went a question and Rohit zeroed in on where he felt his batsmen went wrong. “When you come to these conditions, more than technique, you have to have faith in yourself. You need to have a plan – that’s most important. Everyone has their own technique – we can’t say ‘play close to the body, leave outside off’; everyone has their own technique but individual plan is more important. To understand their bowler’s strengths – they also had slightly inexperienced bowlers. You have to keep all this in mind.”Rohit himself had fallen pulling in the first innings, the 7th time in his last 20 overseas innings he has fallen to that shot. The young opener Yashasvi Jaiswal edged a flamboyant drive in the first innings, and was surprised by the bouncer in the second. Shubman Gill was strangled down leg-side in the first, and fell, playing all over a full ball in the second, again failing in the weight-transfer issues he has had for a while now. Shreyas Iyer fell to a similar full ball in the second, that beat the airy waft. Rohit was of the opinion that his batsmen need to adapt to the conditions and learn when and whom to target.“It’s a mix of everything – intent, bit of discipline, and showing extra temperament. You just can’t go with one mindset and say ‘this is how I am going to bat’. You have to adapt. Understand that there will be time when the bowlers are tired and that’s when you cash in,” Rohit said.

He scored the runs at a strike rate of 70-odd I think and he put the bad balls away. That’s intent. We are not going to go out there and swing our bats. These are not conditions for that. There is a thin line between showing intent and getting reckless. Every individual is different and has to understand what better they can do keeping the conditions in mind,” Rohit said. “Motivation isn’t needed. They are all playing international cricket and playing for country.”When the questions hovered over the bowling, Rohit felt Jasprit Bumrah needed more support from the other three bowlers – Mohammed Siraj, Shardul Thakur, and Prasidh Krishna.“Our bowling also. It wasn’t a 450 pitch, we gave too many runs. Happens. We can’t depend on one bowler. The other three also need to do their roles. We have to learn from the opposing team.“Bumrah bowled really well. All he wanted was a bit of support from the other side which he didn’t get. It can happen. They tried but it didn’t work out. Games like this teaches you a lot of things about what you can do as a bowling group and come back stronger from this game,” said Rohit.The Indian captain also noted that even South Africa had a couple of inexperienced bowlers but they regrouped well as a unit. This was in reference to a question on Prasidh Krishna and his inexperience with red-ball cricket. He also said that the team will back Prasidh. “I agree he hasn’t played a lot of cricket but there are 3 guys in their team  [South Africa’s] also who haven’t played a lot of cricket and they showed how to do it. It’s not about legs, it’s about your mind. If you think you haven’t played too many first class games, then it wont’ work. You have to be grateful for the opportunity. He has shown that he has a lot of potential, and been with the team for a while. Obviously he felt pressure, nervous. “But the guy has the game to excel in this format. We are going to back him. He has a great attitude about his game which helps us, moving forward.”After a great World Cup with the ball, #MarcoJanses showed his prowess with the bat, helping #SouthAfrica stretch their lead to 163.How will #TeamIndia respond with the bat?Tune-in to #SAvIND 1st Test,LIVE NOW | Star Sports Network pic.twitter.com/zd6wc4BOhg— Star Sports (@StarSportsIndia) December 28, 2023India went to the first Test at Centurion with an intrasquad game, and there have been murmurs whether they should have played a proper practice game against a first-class team. But this is how the Indian team has been doing for a while now, and Rohit reiterated the reason why. “See, we have been playing practice games, first-class also for the last 4 years. But we don’t get the kind of pitch that we get in matches. So, its better to play our own game on our kind of pitch. In Australia also last time, the ball in practice pitches wasn’t bouncing over knees , and you get different pitches in matches. We kept that all in our mind and decided this. Even the bowlers in those practice games are 125 kmph type bowlers. We have experienced that.So it’s better that we play with our bowlers and prepare our kind of pitches.”And from the highs of being cherished for his captaincy in the world cup to the lows of Centurion. On air the likes of Ravi Shastri and other commentators had questioned his decision to start with Prasidh Krishna and Shardul Thakur post lunch on the second day against Dean Elgar and co.He wasn’t asked about any specific instance but was asked to share his feelings on how “disheartening it is as a captain not able to put pressure on the opposition as a batting and bowling unit”. “That’s the job of a captain. It’s not always going to be happy days. These are the days to stand up as a captain and be with the team. We shall analyse what went wrong but also important to leave a loss like this here and not take it with us to Cape Town. When you take the job, this is what you sign for, You will have days like this. I have full confidence in the guys here now.” "
"Friday, Dec 29, 2023","How Imroz’s love built Amrita Pritam, as a woman and a poet",https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/how-imrozs-love-built-amrita-pritam-as-a-woman-and-a-poet-9084955/,"Once, in a conversation about Amrita Pritam and her live-in partner, painter and poet Imroz, Gulzar saab narrated a story that defined their over 45-year-long relationship. The poet and filmmaker, who had known them separately and together, spoke of Imroz almost always addressing Amrita as “Madam” — whether he was talking to her or about her.It was a fascinating and endearing way of acknowledging the seniority of one’s beloved — Amrita was seven years older to Imroz — in a love story marked by deep respect, admiration and devotion. There were times he called her Barkate (abundance). In private letters, he addressed her as Maaja, the name of the heroine in a Spanish novel they had both read and the protagonist in painter Francisco Goya’s paintings, and sometimes as Aashi. But “madam” remained Imroz’s preferred way of referring to Amrita till his death last week, at 97, in Mumbai.After her death in 2005, her impressive oeuvre kept Amrita alive. But if she has endured among us, it has also been through Imroz’s ruminations of her. Once, in a conversation about a book featuring their letters to each other, Imroz told me, “We never used the term ‘love’ or that we loved each other. It was too empty an expression”.Imroz’s passing is not just the loss of a talented artist — it feels like we have lost Amrita all over again. Amrita, the courageous writer whose unflinching look at sexuality and constant quest for liberation and self-realisation was almost unheard of when she began writing. In her world, a woman was meant to live out her desires, with dignity. It was a world that included not just her characters — but her as well.Here was a married woman, a mother, writing of being in love with another man, poet Sahir Ludhianvi, speaking of smoking the half-smoked cigarettes he left behind in her house and how, throughout her pregnancy, she hoped her baby would look like him, even though it was her husband Pritam Singh’s child. Female desire was never this prominent in Indian literature.What Amrita felt for Sahir – the longing, the need to be with him all the time — Imroz felt for her. Born Indarjeet Singh in Layallpur (now Faisalabad in Pakistan), he was an illustrator with the famed Urdu magazine, Shama, when he met Amrita to discuss designing her book covers. She was married and in love with Sahir when she began living with Imroz in the late ’50s. The two also brought out the Punjabi magazine Nagmani together.Sahir, a complicated man and Amrita’s muse, could not give space to love and commitment in his life. While she yearned for a response from him, actual solace and comfort came from Imroz, who not only understood her affections for Sahir but treated them with dignity.Imroz didn’t chide her for tracing Sahir’s name on his back when she sat on his scooter, or when she wrote “Aaj mera khuda mar gaya”, when Sahir died in 1980 due to a sudden cardiac arrest. Instead, he was waking up in the middle of the night, when Amrita felt most comfortable writing, preparing a cup of tea, and keeping it beside her as she worked, without a word exchanged between them. If Amrita sat in her Hauz Khas home with her guests, Imroz would often bring a tray of tea and biscuits. Unlike most men, he never felt awkward about it. Imroz stood like a rock by her in Amrita’s last years, brought up her children with her, and even looked after her ailing husband Pritam Singh in their house till he breathed his last.One might wonder if this disregard for what’s considered normal came from the space that made their creativity possible. And the answer was invariably yes. Imroz’s passionate and unconditional affection led Amrita to ask once in a letter, “Raahi, tum mujhe sandhya bela mein kyun mile, milna tha toh dopeher mein milte, Uss dopeher ka sek toh dekh lete (O passer by, why did you meet me during life’s dusk, if you had to meet me, it should have been in the afternoon, at least then we would have seen the afternoon’s warmth)”. It felt as if only an Imroz could love Amrita Pritam; their kinship was like a sacred song – tender, with great meaning, and deeply spiritual.“Main ek lok geet (I’m a folk song)” – Imroz once wrote about himself. And, as usual, he got to the heart of the matter in an instant: A man not in any need of acknowledgement of his authorship (he never signed his paintings), but someone who was content flowing like a song, travelling like a river. That was Imroz — secure, devoted and in love with Amrita, something, I believe, that helped build her as a woman and as a writer.As a tribute to their relationship, Gulzar wrote, Teri nazm se guzarte waqt khadsha rehta hai/ Paanv rakh raha hoon jaise geele canvas par Imroz ke/ Teri nazm se image ubharti hai/ Brush se rang tapakne lagta hai/ Woh apne kore canvas par nazme likhta hai/ Tum apne kaagzon par nazme paint karti ho (While passing through your poem, I fear/ that I’m stepping onto Imroz’s wet canvas/ An image emerges from your poem/ Colour drips off the brush/He writes a poem on his blank canvas/ You, on your paper, lend colours to poems).suanshu.khurana@expressindia.com
